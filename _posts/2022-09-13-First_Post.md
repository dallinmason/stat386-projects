Statistics (from German: Statistik, orig. "description of a state, a country") is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.
In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. 
Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". 
Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.[1]
