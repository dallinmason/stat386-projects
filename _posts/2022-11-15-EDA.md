# Introduction

Fall. Don't we all love it? Change hangs in the air! Bit by bit the days grow shorter. Soon the nights grow bitter cold. Rain turns to sleet and then snow. Holiday magic is almost tangible. Thoughts of reunions with family and loved ones fill our minds. What a season! What is interesting is the change in weather during this time and how rapid or gradual this change can be.

In a past [blog](https://dallinmason.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/18/Data-Scraping.html), we showed how to scrape weather data that was for Salt Lake City, Utah during the Fall of 2022. Interested viewers should definitely check out that post. One can also visit this [website](https://www.localconditions.com/weather-salt-lake-city-utah/84101/past.php) in which the past data is obtained from but note that the data changes every five minutes and only contains the past 30 days. What interest us now is exploring this data to find out a bit more about the patterns that were exhibited by Mother Nature during this transition time into Fall. 

## Data

In the blog post mentioned before, we scraped data from September 19 to October 14. We further decided to expand this dataset to include more of the transition time period that fall has and so scraped some more data from the 19th of October to the 11th of November. As we explore our data we will at times use combinations if not all of this data which will be made clear to the reader.


## Exploration
It is always fascinating to see the trends the weather has over time. So I combined all of the weather data and made some graphs based on certain weather features.


First off is one comparing the temperatures at 12:00 PM each day for the entire collected time.
