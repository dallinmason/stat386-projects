# Introduction

Fall. Don't we all love it? Change hangs in the air! Bit by bit the days grow shorter. Soon the nights grow bitter cold. Rain turns to sleet and then snow. Holiday magic is almost tangible. Thoughts of reunions with family and loved ones fill our minds. What a season! What adds to this change is not only the timing of the year but also the weather. This transition to fall weather is very interesting to study as it can either be a gradual transition or a sudden event and that is what this post will explore.

In a past [blog](https://dallinmason.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/18/Data-Scraping.html), we showed how to scrape weather data that was for Salt Lake City, Utah during the Fall of 2022. Interested viewers should definitely check out that post. One can also visit this [website](https://www.localconditions.com/weather-salt-lake-city-utah/84101/past.php) in which the past data is obtained from but note that the data changes every five minutes and only contains the past 30 days. What interests us now is exploring this data to find out a bit more about the patterns that were exhibited by Mother Nature during this transition time into Fall. 

## Data

In the blog post mentioned before, we scraped data from September 19 to October 14. This data includes temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed, and dew point. We grabbed this information about the weather every 2 hour starting at 6am and going till 10pm. One change we decided to implement further was expanding the original timeframe of the dataset to include more of the transition into fall and so to do this we scraped some more data from the 19th of October to the 11th of November. So all in all, this data contains weather from Septemeber 19 till November 11 with a slight few missing days in the middle due to the constant update of the website. This will be the data that we will work with in this post. 


## General Trends
In this first part of our Exploratory Data Analysis, we will go through a few general trends that we spotted in our weather data and explore them. It is always fascinating to see the trends the weather has over time. So using the data we made some graphs based on certain weather conditions that were recorded.


The first graph is one comparing the temperatures at 12:00 PM each day for the entire collected time.

As we can see here the temperatures definitely have cooled off on average as we have gone from September to November. 

Secondly we have a graph of humidity to see the different humidity levels also at noon.

It is interesting here to note how humidity levels have the opposite trend as the noon temperatures do.

Next we show the Barometric Pressure at noon. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dallinmason/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/Bar1.png" alt="" style="width:700px;"/>

It is very interesting here how the pressure is just about the same at noon every day. This makes sense as the pressure at any given place is usually roughly the same unless some drastic weather changes are happening. 

Finally we look at the Dew Point at noon across all the data.

So in general it looks like the temperature and dew point decreased on average over the course of the transition to fall. This is not surprising as one would expect this trend to happen as the days grow colder because of the onset of winter. Barametric pressure stays the same overall which is expected. What is interesting, however, is to examine how the humidity at noon seems to increase as the transition continues. This could be because of a variety of reasons but is very interesting to observe. 

Another thing that is interesting to look at it the trends of the weather over a daily period. We created a table that contains the mean values for all columns of our original dataset but applied to all of our data. Here is what we got:
        
### Table of Means

It is cool to compare what general trends we see here. They match the same trends that we saw in our graphics. We would expect temperatures to rise during the day and fall at night but it is also interesting to note humidity levels doing the exact opposite. Furthermore, dew points seem to follow the same trend as humidity but less extreme. 

Now that we have shown the overall trends of our data, we will briefly highlight some key parts of our Exploratory Data Analysis. There are a million things that one could explore and that would drag on forever so in the interest of time we will explore two questions: #1- Is there a relationship between humidity and temperature & #2- Is there a relationship between humidity and barometric pressure?



### Question #1: Is there a relationship between humidity and temperature?

We always talk about the different ways humidity affects us. In general it makes weather more extreme on all accounts. Tornadoes and hurricanes are both influenced by the amount of humidity in the air. The cold feels colder and the hot hotter when humidity is higher. However an interesting question might be what is the correlation, if any, between humidity and temperature?

We will explore this question by making a graph with a linear regression model fit for our data and then calculate the correlation between these two. 

Our graph is as follows:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dallinmason/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/LR1.png" alt="" style="width:500px;"/>


As we see from this graph there is a clear downward trend in the humidity as the temperature rises. Furthermore, we calculated the correlation coefficient to be -0.81734. This confirms that there is a pretty strong negative correlation coefficient between humidity and temperature suggesting that as the temperature rises, the temperature decreases.

This is really quite interesting. It could be caused by several factors including the amount of sunlight or tendency of storms to cool things off or other variables. The purpose of this post is not to provide explanations for our data but rather report the tendencies of our data. However, the interested reader may find it a fascinating task to consider what might cause this occurence. 


### Question #2: Is there a relationship between humidity and the barometric pressure?

Another question that would be great to answer is whether or not there is a relationship between the humidity and barometric pressure. This would be a fascinating relationship to make some observations about because barometric pressure can affect some sensitive groups and so if we could determine if humidity somehow is related to that then people might make different choices on where the live at what times of the year based on when humidity is highest.

So, we will follow a similar pattern of examining a linear regression fit for all of our the data and then also calculate the correlation.

Our model turns out to show: 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dallinmason/stat386-projects/main/assets/images/BarVS1.png" alt="" style="width:500px;"/>

This shows a slight negative relationship between humidity and barometric pressure so as the humidity increases, the barometric pressure drops slightly on average. This is further confirmed by the correlation which is caluclated to be -0.1931. This is definitely not strong evidence that barometric pressure will drop always but does give some validity to the fact that there is a negative relationship. So, all in all we do see that a slightly negative correlation can be argued based on the data we collected. 




## Conclusion and Invitations

Overall, we have shown a bit of our exploration into our weather data during the Fall of 2022 and have shown some trends among humidity, temperature, and barometric pressure. We found that there is indeed a negative correlation between humidity and temperature that is quite noticeable. We also found that humidity and barometric pressure also have a negative correlation but one that is less extreme. So, the next question might be, are these trends really something that occur normally or was this just coincidence?
