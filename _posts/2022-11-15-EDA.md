# Introduction

Fall. Don't we all love it? Change hangs in the air! Bit by bit the days grow shorter. Soon the nights grow bitter cold. Rain turns to sleet and then snow. Holiday magic is almost tangible. Thoughts of reunions with family and loved ones fill our minds. What a season! What is interesting is the change in weather during this time and how rapid or gradual this change can be.

In a past [blog](https://dallinmason.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/18/Data-Scraping.html), we showed how to scrape weather data that was for Salt Lake City, Utah during the Fall of 2022. Interested viewers should definitely check out that post. One can also visit this [website](https://www.localconditions.com/weather-salt-lake-city-utah/84101/past.php) in which the past data is obtained from but note that the data changes every five minutes and only contains the past 30 days. What interest us now is exploring this data to find out a bit more about the patterns that were exhibited by Mother Nature during this transition time into Fall. 

## Data

In the blog post mentioned before, we scraped data from September 19 to October 14. We further decided to expand this dataset to include more of the transition time period that fall has and so scraped some more data from the 19th of October to the 11th of November. As we explore our data we will at times use combinations if not all of this data which will be made clear to the reader.


## General Trends
It is always fascinating to see the trends the weather has over time. So I combined all of the weather data and made some graphs based on certain weather features that were recorded.


First off is one comparing the temperatures at 12:00 PM each day for the entire collected time.

Secondly we will make one of humidity to see the different humidity levels also at noon.

Next we examine the Barometric Pressure at noon.

It is very interesting here how the pressure is just about the same at noon every day. This makes sense as the pressure at any given place is usually roughly the same unless some drastic weather changes are happening. 

Finally we look at the Dew Point at noon across all the data.

So in general it looks like the temperature and dew point has decreased on average over the course of the transition to fall. This is not surprising as one would expect this trend to happen as the days grow colder because of the onset of winter. Barametric pressure stays the same overall which is expected. What is interesting, however, is to examine how the humidity at noon seems to increase as the transition continues. This could be because of a variety of reasons but is very interesting to observe. 


We will generate some ideas here. We will look at trends over time and trends at specific time. We could examine so many different combinations but we will foccus on 3 main ideas. Idea #1, what is the relationship between Humidity and Temperature. Idea #2, what is the relationship between rainfall and humidity, and Idea #3, is there a general trend between Humidity during the fall period, we know there is for temperature but what about humidity? 

Other ideas include finding means for temperatures every day, finding mean humidity every day, finding 

### Question #1: Is there a relationship between humidity and temperature?

We always talk about the different ways humidity affects us. In general it makes weather more extreme on all accounts. Tornadoes and hurricanes are both influenced by the amount of humidity in the air. The cold feels colder and the hot hotter when humidity is higher. However the real question might be what is the correlation, if any, between humidity and temperature?

We will explore this question by making a graph with a linear regression model fit for our data and then calculate the correlation between these two. 

Our graph is as follows:

We calculated the correlation coefficient to be -0.81734. This suggests that there is a pretty strong negative correlation coefficient between humidity and temperature suggesting that as the temperature rises, the temperature decreases.

This is really quite interesting. It could be caused by several factors including the amount of sunlight or tendency of storms to cool things off or other variables. The purpose of this post is not to provide explanations for our data but rather report the tendencies of our data. However, the interested reader may find it a fascinating task to consider what might cause this occurence. 


### Question #2: Is there a relationship between humidity and the precipitation received?

In our most recent data collected we also included the precipitation amounts that fell during those days. We would like to find out if there is a relationship between the amount of rainfall received and the level of humidity in the air.
