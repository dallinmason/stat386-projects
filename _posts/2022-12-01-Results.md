# Thoughts on Data Collection Project

Throughout the last few posts I have shown how I obtained the past weather for Salt Lake City for the transition into Fall during 2022. I scraped this data from a website containing the past weather data. After obtaining this data I cleaned it up to include data from September to November to capture the complete transition into fall period. After cleaning up the data, I performed an exploratory analysis on this data to search for what relationships I could find between variables. I really had no idea if there was a relationship between humidity and pressure or heat or any of them so it was pretty fascinating to dive deeper and explore. I made several plots showing general trends over time of all of these variables. Then I made some linear regression plots to be able to visually see if there was a clear relationship between any of these variables. Finally, we performed some statistically calculations to get some actual numbers to verify what we were seeing. Then I narrowed down the relationships to the most obvious ones and ended up with analyzing temperature's affect on humidity.
