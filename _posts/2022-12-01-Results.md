# Thoughts on Data Collection Project

Throughout the last few posts I have shown how I obtained the past weather for Salt Lake City for the transition into Fall during 2022. I scraped this data from a website containing the past weather data. After obtaining this data I cleaned it up to include data from September to November to capture the complete transition into fall period. After cleaning up the data, I performed an exploratory analysis on this data to search for what relationships I could find between variables. I really had no idea if there was a relationship between humidity and pressure or heat or any of them so it was pretty fascinating to dive deeper and explore. I made several plots showing general trends over time of all of these variables. Then I made some linear regression plots to be able to visually see if there was a clear relationship between any of these variables. Finally, we performed some statistically calculations to get some actual numbers to verify what we were seeing. Then I narrowed down the relationships to the most obvious ones and ended up with analyzing temperature's affect on humidity. 


# Data Story

My main question has been what has been the overall trend for this fall's weather and what, if any, relationships can be found between the different measurements of weather this fall. It was no surprise to see that the temperature had an overall gradual downward trend with a sharp drop as fall finally hit. The most surprising observation that I made though, had to do with a relationship that I discovered between the temperature and humidity. In running some regression calculations I discovered that there is a strong correlation between these two variables. Initially I observed an upward trend in humidity over time which I thought was interesting but didn't really think much more of it. But, when comparing this with the downward trend in temperature, I found that this is actually quite a strong relationship. Therefore, according to our data, we see that there is indeed a relationship between our measurements, specifically that of temeprature and humidity.
