# The Rosetta Stone of Merging Tables



For those of us who are further advanced along our programming knowledge and have dabbled in a few of the statistical coding languages, keeping track of syntax can be a nightmare! It seems like as soon as you get in the mindset of one language, the next one is out the window again! 

How can we fix this??

The goal of this tutorial is to help us keep track of how R and SAS use different commands to do the same thing, merge two tables together.


## Merging
Most, if not all of you, have probably encountered situations where two statistical tables become necessary to join in order to compute accurate results about a certain set of data. The easiest way to do this is to merge them together using the language you are manipulating the data in. 


Among the most common used languages in statistics is R and so you may find yourself using this language in your career if you have not used it before. Another less common programming language is SAS which usually takes a license to use so most people, unless in a healthcare industry, will not use SAS. However, for those who might eventually use it, I have chosen to compare SAS and R in this tutorial and show the differences between merging two tables in these languages.

We will start with going through the basics of merging in R.

 # R Merging
 
 
We will go through the different merges with examples of how to do so. I will start with using a dataset that compares different acclaimed universities and their counts of statistical undergraduates per year.

We will merge this table with that comparing these same schools and their tuition cost for the same years.
