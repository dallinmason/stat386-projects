# A Walkthrough of Obtaining Past Weather Data for Salt Lake City

Weather plays an important factor in decision making whether we consciously choose to ignore it 
or not. Thus an analysis of the past weather can be valuable. This is of great interest to many people 
as it can help predict how certain holidays such as Halloween or Thanksgiving might play out. Will it 
be too warm or too cold to eat outside? Does there appear to be much wind during these transition months?
All of these questions and more we hope to be able to explain with this dataset which we will gather and use here in future posts.

First off it is important to understand a little bit about the climate of Utah. Utah is a state that always claims to have the greatest snow on Earth. It proudly bears all 4 seasons and the almost the majority of the year is spent during the winter months due to its being part of the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Summers generally don't rise about 102 °F during their hottest parts and winter temperatures generally never dip below 0 °F. Precipitation is most common in the form of snow which can be quite frequent during the winter months which is always very well celebrated by avid skiers and snow-boarders. An occasional thunderstorm can provide relief during the scorching months of summer though.

Overall, the weather does very quite a bit from one part of the year to another which is a motivation for our question of interest. We would like to analyze past weather data from the transition from summer into fall to determine any major differences between temperatures, barometric pressure, windspeed, humidity, and dew point and to see if these factors can help us explain how this beautiful transition occurs.  


## Objective
So in deciding how to go about obtaining the past weather in Salt Lake City we went to several websites
to be able to decide which one worked best. We found a website that was extremely useful and provided very
accurate information and so decided to use it. The website is found at
[https://www.localconditions.com/weather-salt-lake-city-utah/84101/past.php](https://www.localconditions.com/weather-salt-lake-city-utah/84101/past.php)
We decided to begin do a little bit of webscraping to see if we could obtain this information.

Next we will go through a general outline of this process to explain how we were able to obtain this past weather data.
