# A Walkthrough of Obtaining Past Weather Data for Salt Lake City



Weather plays an important factor in decision making whether we consciously choose to ignore it 
or not. Thus an analysis of the past weather can be valuable. This is of great interest to many people 
as it can help predict how certain holidays such as Halloween or Thanksgiving might play out. Will it 
be too warm or too cold to eat outside? Does there appear to be much wind during these transition months?
All of these questions and more we hope to be able to explain with this dataset. 


## Objective
So in deciding how to go about obtaining the past weather in Salt Lake City we went to several websites
to be able to decide which one worked best. We found a website that was extremely useful and provided very
accurate information and so decided to use it. The website is found at
[https://www.localconditions.com/weather-salt-lake-city-utah/84101/past.php](https://www.localconditions.com/weather-salt-lake-city-utah/84101/past.php)
We decided to begin do a little bit of webscraping to see if we could obtain this information
