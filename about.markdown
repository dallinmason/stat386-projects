# About Me
I am a Statistics Major at BYU with an emphasis in Data Science. I have been in the Statistics Program for 2 years at BYU and have 2 more years left. I love learning about statistics and their usefulness in the real world.

Part of this comes from who I am. I was born in Mesa, Arizona in 2000 and lived there for the majority of my elementary school days. We moved to Bountiful, UT in 2011 and that is where my Dad, Clint Mason, started a new job as a children's leukemia disease researcher at the Huntsman Cancer Institute. Coming home each day he would explain to us what projects he was working on and so my goal to join him one day in the workforce as a Statistician was born. 

Now that I am in college I find myself drawn more to the data science field and industry based statistics fields but my appreciation for my father's teaching and lessons has endured.

When I am not studying one can find me out running as I follow fellow Statistician and Olympian Jared Ward in that pursuit. Though I have not run a marathon, that is a goal I have for myself. I also enjoy playing disc golf, volleyball, and basically any sport out there!
